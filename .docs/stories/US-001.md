# User Story: US-001 - Calculate Business Date with Days Parameter

## Status: TODO

## Description:

As a API integrator, I want add a number of business days to the current or provided date so that I can get the resulting UTC date accounting for weekends and holidays.

## Acceptance Criteria:

- [ ] API accepts "days" as a positive integer query parameter.
- [ ] If no "date" provided, uses current Colombia time as start.
- [ ] Skips weekends (Sat-Sun) and holidays from the JSON resource.
- [ ] Adds days starting from the adjusted business start time.
- [ ] Returns {"date": "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ"} in 200 OK.
- [ ] Testable via example: From a business day at 8:00 a.m., adding 1 day returns next business day at 8:00 a.m. in UTC.

## Task Groups

1. - [ ] Implement core business day calculation logic
    1. - [ ] Fetch and cache Colombian holidays from JSON resource
    2. - [ ] Implement logic to skip weekends and holidays
    3. - [ ] Handle time zone conversions to America/Bogota
2. - [ ] Create API endpoint for days parameter
    1. - [ ] Add GET route in Express for /calculate
    2. - [ ] Validate days parameter as positive integer
    3. - [ ] Compute and return UTC date in JSON response
