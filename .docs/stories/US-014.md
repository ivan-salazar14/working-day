# User Story: US-014 - Secure API Access

## Status: TODO

## Description:

As a API integrator, I want the API to be accessible securely over HTTPS with no authentication but protection against abuse.

## Acceptance Criteria:

- [ ] Deployment uses HTTPS.
- [ ] Optional rate limiting (e.g., 100 requests/min per IP).
- [ ] Validates query strings to prevent injection.
- [ ] Testable: Access via HTTP redirects to HTTPS; excessive requests throttled.

## Task Groups

1. - [ ] Implement HTTPS deployment
    1. - [ ] Configure server for HTTPS
    2. - [ ] Redirect HTTP to HTTPS
2. - [ ] Add rate limiting
    1. - [ ] Implement IP-based rate limiting
    2. - [ ] Throttle excessive requests
3. - [ ] Validate inputs against injection
    1. - [ ] Sanitize query parameters
    2. - [ ] Prevent SQL or code injection

## Estimation: 3 story points

## Developer Notes:

- Use middleware for rate limiting and validation.
