# User Story: US-004 - Use Custom Start Date in UTC

## Status: TODO

## Description:

As a API integrator, I want provide a start date in UTC so that calculations begin from that point converted to Colombia time.

## Acceptance Criteria:

- [ ] API accepts "date" in ISO 8601 UTC format with Z suffix.
- [ ] Converts to America/Bogota for business logic.
- [ ] Adjusts to nearest prior business time if invalid.
- [ ] Works with days, hours, or both.
- [ ] Returns result in UTC.
- [ ] Testable via example: With "date=2025-04-10T15:00:00Z", days=5, hours=4, skips holidays, returns "2025-04-21T20:00:00Z".

## Task Groups

1. - [ ] Add date parameter support
    1. - [ ] Validate ISO 8601 UTC format with Z
    2. - [ ] Convert UTC to America/Bogota time zone
    3. - [ ] Adjust to nearest business time if needed
2. - [ ] Integrate with existing calculation logic
    1. - [ ] Use custom date as start for days/hours
    2. - [ ] Ensure conversions back to UTC for response

## Estimation: 4 story points

## Developer Notes:

- Use date-fns-tz for conversions.
- Adjust start time to business hours if outside.
