# User Story: US-004 - Use Custom Start Date in UTC

## Status: DONE

## Description:

As a API integrator, I want provide a start date in UTC so that calculations begin from that point converted to Colombia time.

## Acceptance Criteria:

- [ ] API accepts "date" in ISO 8601 UTC format with Z suffix.
- [ ] Converts to America/Bogota for business logic.
- [ ] Adjusts to nearest prior business time if invalid.
- [ ] Works with days, hours, or both.
- [ ] Returns result in UTC.
- [ ] Testable via example: With "date=2025-04-10T15:00:00Z", days=5, hours=4, skips holidays, returns "2025-04-21T20:00:00Z".

## Task Groups

1. - [x] Add date parameter support
    1. - [x] Validate ISO 8601 UTC format with Z
    2. - [x] Convert UTC to America/Bogota time zone
    3. - [x] Adjust to nearest business time if needed
2. - [x] Integrate with existing calculation logic
    1. - [x] Use custom date as start for days/hours
    2. - [x] Ensure conversions back to UTC for response

## Estimation: 4 story points

## Developer Notes:

- Custom start date support already implemented in use case with UTC to Bogota conversion and business time adjustment
