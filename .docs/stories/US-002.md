# User Story: US-002 - Calculate Business Date with Hours Parameter

## Status: DONE

## Description:

As a API integrator, I want add a number of business hours to the current or provided date so that I can get the resulting UTC time respecting business hours and lunch break.

## Acceptance Criteria:

- [ ] API accepts "hours" as a positive integer query parameter.
- [ ] Computes within 8:00 a.m. - 5:00 p.m., excluding 12:00-1:00 p.m.
- [ ] Rolls over to next business day if hours exceed remaining in day.
- [ ] Adjusts start time backward to nearest business time if outside hours.
- [ ] Returns {"date": "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ"} in 200 OK.
- [ ] Testable via example: From Friday 5:00 p.m., adding 1 hour returns Monday 9:00 a.m. in UTC.
