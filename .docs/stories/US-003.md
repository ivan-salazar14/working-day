# User Story: US-003 - Calculate Business Date with Both Days and Hours

## Status: DONE

## Description:

As a API integrator, I want add both days and hours in sequence so that days are added first, then hours.

## Acceptance Criteria:

- [ ] Handles holidays and business hours correctly in sequence.
- [ ] Returns {"date": "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ"} in 200 OK.
- [ ] Testable via example: From Tuesday 3:00 p.m., adding 1 day and 4 hours returns Thursday 10:00 a.m. in UTC.
