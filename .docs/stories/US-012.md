# User Story: US-012 - Handle Large Additions Efficiently

## Status: TODO

## Description:

As a API integrator, I want the API to handle large days/hours without performance issues.

## Acceptance Criteria:

- [ ] Processes additions like days=1000 efficiently.
- [ ] No timeouts; response under 1 second.
- [ ] Testable: Simulate large input and check response time.

## Task Groups

1. - [ ] Optimize calculation algorithms
    1. - [ ] Use efficient loops for large additions
    2. - [ ] Cache results where possible
    3. - [ ] Ensure O(n) complexity

## Estimation: 3 story points

## Developer Notes:

- Test with large inputs to ensure performance.
