# User Story: US-015 - Set Up Base Project with Hexagonal Architecture

## Status: DONE

## Description:

As a developer, I want set up the base project structure using hexagonal architecture with Vite so that the codebase is organized for maintainability and testability.

## Acceptance Criteria:

- [x] Create src/domain directory for core business logic, entities, and value objects
- [x] Create src/application directory for use cases and application services
- [x] Create src/infrastructure directory for adapters and external integrations
- [x] Create src/presentation directory for API endpoints and controllers
- [x] Configure Vite for TypeScript project with proper build settings
- [x] Set up TypeScript configuration with strict typing
- [x] Initialize package.json with dependencies: Vite, Express.js, Zod, Luxon, date-fns-tz
- [x] Create basic folder structure for ports and adapters
- [x] Ensure no JavaScript files; all code in TypeScript

## Task Groups

1. - [ ] Set up project directory structure
    1. - [ ] Create src/ with domain, application, infrastructure, presentation subdirs
    2. - [ ] Add basic index files for each layer
2. - [ ] Configure build and development tools
    1. - [ ] Initialize Vite configuration for backend API
    2. - [ ] Set up TypeScript compiler options
    3. - [ ] Configure package.json scripts for build and dev
3. - [ ] Install and configure dependencies
    1. - [ ] Add Express.js for HTTP server
    2. - [ ] Add Zod for validation
    3. - [ ] Add Luxon for date/time handling
    4. - [ ] Ensure all packages support TypeScript

## Estimation: 5 story points

## Developer Notes:

- Use Vite for fast development and building
- Follow hexagonal architecture principles: domain at center, dependencies inward
- Prepare for DDD implementation
- Project structure created with all layers: domain, application, infrastructure, presentation
- Configured Vite, TypeScript, and package.json with required dependencies
- All files in TypeScript, no JavaScript
